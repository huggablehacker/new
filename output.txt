|     State: VULNERABLE
|     IDs:  CVE:CVE-2014-3566  OSVDB:113251
|           The SSL protocol 3.0, as used in OpenSSL through 1.0.1i and
|           other products, uses nondeterministic CBC padding, which makes it easier
|           for man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain cleartext data via a
|           padding-oracle attack, aka the "POODLE" issue.
|     Disclosure date: 2014-10-14

|       TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA
